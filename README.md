#### Purpose

The purpose of *Checkmate* is to use an online application to create to-do lists for any occasion, whether it be personal or business related. To-do lists help people and businesses to be more organised when trying to reach a goal. A list can make everything more manageable as people can see a clear outline of the completed and uncompleted tasks. Thus keeping individuals and businesses mentally focused. 

#### Checkmate Vision

Version 1 of the *Checkmate* application will allow an end user to create a new list and add as many items they want. From here, they can edit the item on the list, delete or mark that the item has been completed. The data is stored in cookies which has no time limit for destruction. 

Version 2* of the *Checkmate* application will allow users to login or sign up to create and access their lists enabling them to store this data and access it anywhere at anytime. In addition to this, it enables the end user to create more than one list for any occasion.
